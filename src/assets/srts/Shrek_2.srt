1
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:24,334
<i>Once upon a time
in a kingdom far, faraway,</i>

2
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,963
<i>the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.</i>

3
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,425
<i>And throughout the land,
everyone was happy</i>

4
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,553
<i>until the sun went down</i>

5
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,640
<i>and they saw that their daughter
was cursed with a frightful enchantment</i>

6
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,435
<i>that took hold each and every night.</i>

7
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,107
<i>Desperate, they sought the help
of a fairy godmother</i>

8
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,985
<i>who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower,</i>

9
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,614
<i>there to await the kiss
of the handsome Prince Charming.</i>

10
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,536
<i>It was he who would chance
the perilous journey</i>

11
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,831
<i>through blistering cold
and scorching desert,</i>

12
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,250
<i>traveling for many days and nights,</i>

13
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,085
<i>risking life and limb</i>

14
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>to reach the Dragon's Keep.</i>

15
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,304
For he was the bravest

16
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,432
and most handsome...

17
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,228
in all the land.

18
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,273
And it was destiny that his kiss

19
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,361
would break the dreaded curse.

20
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,574
He alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower

21
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:43,372
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,

22
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,415
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her--

23
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,126
What?

24
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,797
- Princess Fiona?
- No!

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,966
Oh, thank heavens. Where is she?

26
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,259
She's on her honeymoon.

27
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,804

Shrek! Fiona!

61
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,716
Well, aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

62
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,927
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

63
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,473
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How about a side of sugar for the steed?

64
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,767
Donkey, what are you doing here?

65
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,894
I was just taking care of
your love nest for you.

66
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,649
Oh, you mean like sorting the mail
and watering the plants.

67
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,984
Yeah, and feeding the fish.

68
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,318
I don't have any fish.

69
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,530
You do now.
I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.

70
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,032
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

71
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,160
Oh, will you look at the time.
Well, I guess you'd better be going.

72
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,912
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?

73
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,582
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

74
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,586
Actually, Donkey?
Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon?

75
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,337
Oh, yeah, that.

76
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,425
I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

77
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,427
So I thought I'd move back in
with you guys.

78
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,221
Well, you know we're always
happy to see you, Donkey.

79
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,932
But Fiona and I are married now.

80
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,185
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

81
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,564
Just with each other.

82
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,901
Alone.

83
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,612
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

84
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,656
I will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

85
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,450
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?

86
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,868
You're bothering me.

87
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,039
Oh, okay. Uh, all right, cool.
I guess, uh...

88
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,626
Me and Pinocchio was just going
to try to catch a tournament, anyway.

89
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,713
So, uh, maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

90
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,970
He'll be fine. Now, where were we?

91
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,140
Ooh. I think I remember.

92
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,353
Donkey!

93
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,689
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.

94
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,399
But what do you want me
to tell these guys?

95
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,038
Enough, Reggie.

96
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,503
"Dearest Princess Fiona.

97
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,799
You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

98
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,803
for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

99
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,972
at which time the King

100
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:57,435
will bestow his royal blessing
upon you and your, uh--

101
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,312
Uh, Prince Charming.

102
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:04,150
Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away.

103
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,569
Aka Mom and Dad."

104
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,029
Mom and Dad?

105
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,491
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?

106
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,368
- We're not going.
- What?

107
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,287
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit

108
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,499
shocked to see you like this?

109
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,210
Well, they might be a bit surprised.

110
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,380
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

111
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,674
And don't worry.
They're gonna love you too.

112
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,594
Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think
I'll be welcome at the country club.

113
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,471
Will you stop it.
They're not like that.

114
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,142
Then how do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

115
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,562
Oh, come on!
You could at least give them a chance.

116
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,647
Oh, to do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?

117
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,608
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

118
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,779
Oh, great. Now I need their blessing?

119
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,323
Well, if you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

120
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,451
And who says I want
to be part of this family?

121
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,537
Uh, you did!
When you married me!

122
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,706
Well, there's some fine print for you!

123
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,834
So-- So that's it.
You won't come?

124
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:08,006
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going and that's final!

125
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,510
Hey, come on, Shrek!
We don't want to hit traffic!

126
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,974
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

127
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,061

That's not funny.

148
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,669
That's really immature.

149
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,421
This is why nobody likes ogres.

150
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,756
All right! Your loss!

151
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,467
- I'm gonna just stop talking!
- Finally!

152
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,888
But this is taking forever, Shrek.
There ain't no in-flight movie or nothing.

153
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,101
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

154
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,313
That's where we're going. Far, far...

155
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,023
...away!

156
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,694
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.

157
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,280
Well, find a way to entertain yourself.

158
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,722
For five minutes,

159
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:25,310
could you not be yourself
for five minutes!

160
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,110
Are we there yet?

161
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,362
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

162
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,668
Wow!

163
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,840
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

164
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,260
Hey, good looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

165
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,804
- Star maps! Get your star maps!
- Ooh, panty hose!

166
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,521
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

167
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,608
Halt.

Hey, everyone look!

170
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:39,175
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
Yeah. You working that hat.

171
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,144
Swimming pools! Movie stars!

172
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,349
Announcing the long-awaited return

173
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,937
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

174
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,482
Well, this is it.

175
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,526
- This is it.
- This is it.

176
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,819
This is it.

177
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,511
Uh, why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

178
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,601
So...

179
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,479
...you still think this is a good idea?

180
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,983
Of course. Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

181
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,985
Who on earth are they?

182
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,071
I think that's our little girl.

183
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,657
That's not little.
That's a really big problem.

184
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,911
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

185
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,373
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look--

186
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,210
Happy now? We came. We saw them.

187
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,796
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

188
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,216
- They're my parents.
- Hello, they locked you in a tower.

189
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
Hey, that was for my own--

190
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,262
Good! Now here's our chance.
Let's go back inside and pretend we're not home.

191
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,806
Harold, we have to be--

192
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,725
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

193
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,894
Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be--

194
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,313
A disaster! There is no way--

195
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,023
- You can do this.
- But I really--

196
00:14:59,107 --> 00:14:59,941
- Really--
- Really--

00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,317
Don't-- Want-- To-- Be--

198
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,610
Here!

199
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,365
Mom,

200
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,825
Dad...

201
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,246
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

202
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,792
Well, um--

203
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:23,005
It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

204
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,994
Hmm.

205
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,003
Excuse me.

206
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,714
Better out than in, I always say,
eh, Fiona?

207
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,968
That's good.

208
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,971
- Uh...
- I guess not.

209
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,639
What do you mean, "not on the list"?

210
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,600
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

211
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,020
Hey, what's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

212
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,605
I had the hardest time finding this place.

213
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,024
No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

214
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,486
No, no, no, Dad. Dad, it's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

215
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,072
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- Yep, that's me, the noble steed.

216
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,074
Hey, waiter!
How about a bowl for the steed?

217
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,242
Oh, boy.

218
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,080
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?

219
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,626
Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs. Q.

220
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,252
- Mmm.
- No, no, no.

221
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,545
Darling.

222
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,840
Oh!

223
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,221
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.

224
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:57,975
Well, Shrek owns his own land.

225
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,478
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

226
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,439
It's in an enchanted forest,

227
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,942
abundant in squirrels

228
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,903
and cute little duckies and--

229
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,322
What? I know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

230
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,201
- Donkey!
- An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original.

231
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,163
Well, I suppose that would be
a fine place to raise the children.

232
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,756
Ah...

233
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,468
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

234
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,471
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!

235
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,224
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, okay?

236
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,102
- Well, for his type, yes.
- My type?

237
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,020
I got to go to the bathroom.

238
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,524
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.

239
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,033
- <i>Bon appétit!</i>
- Oh, Mexican food! My favorite.

240
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,870
Well, let's not just sit here with our
tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.

241
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,163
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

242
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:05,084
So, I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be--

243
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,003
Ogres, yes!

244
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,548
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

245
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,508
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

246
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,678
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

247
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,138
- Dad!
- Oh, no.

248
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,683
We usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

249
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,978
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.

250
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,939
Oh, aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

251
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,108
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

252
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,117
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

253
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,873
- Harold!
- Shrek!

254
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,957
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

255
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,292
- Mom!
- Harold--

Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother,

300
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,221
but I really don't need all this.

301
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,017
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

302
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,646
Fiona? Fiona!

303
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,444
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

304
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,821
Oh, uh--

305
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,990
Fairy Godmother, furniture,

306
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,868
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

307
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:11,747
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

308
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,624
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

309
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,209
But that can't be right.

310
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,294
Oh, great, more relatives.

311
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,171
She's just trying to help.

312
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,466
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

313
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,260
- What?
- Leaving? I don't want to leave.

314
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,719
When did you decide this?

315
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:26,971
Shortly after arriving.

316
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,806
Look, I-- I'm sorry.

317
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,892
No, no, no, no, that's all right.
Uh, I need to go, anyway.

318
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,437
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me,

319
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,357
happiness is just a teardrop away.

320
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,943
Thanks, but we've got all the happiness
we need.

321
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,903
Happy, happy, happy!

322
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,947
So I see.

323
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,824
Let's go, Kyle.

324
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,328
Very nice, Shrek.

325
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:54,164
What?
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

326
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,917
You could have at least tried
to get along with my father.

327
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:01,422
Somehow I don't think I was gonna get
Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it.

328
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,967
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

329
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,012
Sure. Do you want me to pack for you?

330
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,306
You're unbelievable!

331
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,683
You're behaving like a--

332
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,560
Go on! Say it!

333
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,061
Like an ogre!

334
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,563
Here's a news flash for you!

335
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,857
Whether your parents like it or not,

336
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,525
I am an ogre!

337
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:31,160
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

338
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:41,128
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

339
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,007
That's real smooth, Shrek.

340
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,219
"I'm an ogre!"

341
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,455
- I knew this would happen.
- You should. You started it.

342
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,584
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
I mean, really. He's the ogre, not me.

343
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:24,004
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

344
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,923
This is Fiona's choice.

345
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,802
Yes, but she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked out for her.

346
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,889
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this-- this thing?

347
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,559
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

348
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,230
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

349
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,484
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

350
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,445
Don't you remember when we were young

351
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,948
and, oh, we used to walk down
by the lily pond...

352
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,700
...and they were in bloom...

353
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,034
Our first kiss.

354
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,245
It's not the same!

355
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,124
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

356
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,501
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

357
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,503
Fine! Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

358
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,213
La-di-da-di-da-di-da!

359
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,925
Isn't it all wonderful?
I'd like to know how it could get any worse!

360
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,051
Hello, Harold.

361
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,970
- What happened?
- Oh, n-nothing!

362
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:17,182
Nothing, dear. Just the old, uh,
crusade wound playing up a bit.

363
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,102
I'll, um, just stretch it
out here for a while.

364
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,230
You better get in.
We need to talk.

365
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,983
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
just off to bed.

366
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,319
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

367
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:33,032
So, um, how about--
We-- We make this a quick visit. What?

368
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,826
Oh. Oh, h-hello.

369
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,330
So, what's new?

370
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,500
You remember my son, Prince Charming?

371
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:47,629
Charming! Oh, is that you?
My gosh! It's been years.

372
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,923
I-- When-- When did you get back?

373
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,052
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

374
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,680
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert,

375
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,807
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower--

376
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,477
Mommy can handle this.

377
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,356
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

378
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,610
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower!

379
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,612
- But-- But--
- And what does he find?

380
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,407
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess...

381
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,367
- If I can just...
- ...is already married.

382
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,912
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

383
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,663
Stop the car!

384
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,833
Harold...

385
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:30,589
...you force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

386
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,633
Where are we?

387
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,719
Hi there. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy.
May I take your order?

388
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,389
My diet is ruined!
I hope you're happy.

389
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,810
Uh, okay, two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo, chili rings--

390
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,311
I'll have the Medieval Meal.

391
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,147
Yeah, one Medieval Meal
and, Harold, curly fries?

392
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,566
- Uh, no. No, thank you.
- Sourdough soft taco, then?

393
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,276
- What do you want?
- No, really, I'm fine.

394
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,945
Your order, Fairy Godmother.

395
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,114
And this comes with the Medieval Meal.

396
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,824
Here you are, dear.

397
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,411
You see, we made a deal, Harold,

398
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,289
and I assume you don't want me
to go back on my part.

399
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,999
Indeed not.

400
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,670
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

401
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,712
Yes.

402
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,715
Oh, believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

403
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,717
Not only for your daughter...

404
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,138
...but for your Kingdom.

405
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,186
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

406
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,356
Use your imagination.

407
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,142
Oh.

408
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,938

I need to have someone taken care of.

00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,191
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he-- he's not a guy, per se.

418
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,652
Um, he's an ogre.

419
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,573
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

420
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,618
There's only one fellow
who can handle a job like that,

421
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,829
and, frankly,
he don't like to be disturbed.

422

00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,090

425
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,760
Sorry! I-- I hope I'm not interrupting,
but I'm told you're the one to talk to

426
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,845
about an ogre problem?

427
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,931
You are told correct.

428
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:29,559
But for this,
I charge a great deal of money.

429
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,437
Would this be enough?

430
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:44,032
Hmm. You have engaged
my valuable services, Your Majesty.

431
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,369

<i>...Charming.</i>

458
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,930
S-Sorry. Uh, I--
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

459
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:17,561
No, no, no.
I was just reading a, uh-- a scary book.

460
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:22,732
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

461
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,569
- Okay?
- I don't know what came over me.

462
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,822
Do you suppose we could just pretend
it never happened and start over?

463
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,282
Look, Your Majesty, I--

464
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,783
Please, call me Dad.

465
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:36,496
Dad, we both acted like ogres.

466
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,749
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other?

467
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,876
Excellent idea.

468
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,337
I was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

469
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,339
Little father-son time?

470
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,635
I know it would mean the world to Fiona.

471
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,106
Shall we say, 7:30 by the old oak?

472
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,114
Face it, Donkey. We're lost.

473
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,367
We can't be lost.
We followed the King's instructions exactly.

474
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,786
What did he say? "Head to the deepest,
darkest part of the woods."

475
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,455
- Aye.
- "Past the sinister trees

476
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,415
- with those scary-looking branches."
- Check.

477
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,375
Yeah and there's that bush
shaped like Shirley Bassey.

478
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,961
We passed that bush
three times already!

479
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,589
You were the one who said you
didn't want to stop and get directions.

480
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:32,302
Oh, great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

481
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,513
and I end up lost in the woods with you!

482
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,848
You don't have to get all huffy with me,
I'm only trying to help.

483
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,017
I know! I know.

484
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,562
I'm sorry, all right?

485
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,606
Hey, don't worry about it.

486
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,943
I just really need to make things
work with this guy.

487
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,403
Yeah, sure.
Now, let's go bond with Daddy.

488
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,163
Well, well, well, Donkey.

489
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,875
I know it was kind of a tender moment
back there, but the purring?

490
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,794
Man, what are you talking about?
I ain't purring.

491
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,296
Sure. What's next? A hug?

492
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,173
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.

493
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,716
What you think I am, some kind of--

494
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,886
Ha-ha! Fear me. If you dare.

495
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,097
Hey, look. A little cat.

496
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,642
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.

497
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,644
Come here, little kitty kitty kitty.

498
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,563
Come on, little kitty.

499
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:28,149
Come here. Come here, little kitty.

500
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,071
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Oh, come on! Oh!

501
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,699
Get it off! Oh, get it off!

502
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,869
No! Oh!

503
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,582
- Hold on, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

504
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,791
Shrek, hold still!

505
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,086
Did I miss?

506
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,089
No, you got them.

507
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:58,013
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

508
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,808
Puss in Boots.

509
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,269
I'll kill that cat!

510
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,540
Hair ball.

511
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,208
Oh, that is nasty.

512
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,253
What do you reckon
we should do with him?

513
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,297
I say we take the sword
and neuter him right here.

514
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,632
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

515
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,175
Oh, mother, no. <i>Por favor.</i>

516
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,470
Please, I implore you.
It was nothing personal <i>señor</i>.

517
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,222
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she's sick.

518
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,725
And my father lives off the garbage.

519
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,811
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers--

520
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,855
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

521
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,691
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

522
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,109
The rich King? <i>Si.</i>

523
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,116
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.

524
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,951
Oh, come on, Shrek.
Don't feel bad.

525
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,037
Almost everybody that meets you
wants to kill you.

526
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,246
Gee, thanks.

527
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,587
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

528
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,506
Si! That's what the King said.

529
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,260
Oh, uh-- Sorry.
I thought that question was directed at me.

530
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,348
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'll do anything for her.

531
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,142
Well, it's not like I
wouldn't change if I could.

532
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,730
I just--
I just wish I could make her happy.

533
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,275
Hold the phone.

534
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,487
Happiness.

535
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,699
A tear drop away.

536
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,036
Donkey, think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you.

537
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,664
Oh, man, where do I begin?

538
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,750
First, it was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

539
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,127
I ain't never got over that.

540
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,753
Then this fool went off and had a party

541
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,005
and he have all the guests
trying to pin a tail on me.

542
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,591
Then they all got drunk and started
beating me with a stick going,

543
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,135
"Piñata! Piñata!"

544
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,511
What is a piñata, anyway?

545
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,055
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

546
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,765
Yeah, well, don't go projecting on me.

547
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,892
I know you're feeling bad
but you gotta let your own--

548
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,231
You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of...

549
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,825
<i>What? Is it on? Is it on?</i>

550
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,660
<i>This is Fairy Godmother.</i>

551
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,079
<i>I'm either away from my desk
or with a client.</i>

552
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:32,667
<i>But if you come by the office,
we'll be glad to make you a personal appointment.</i>

553
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,335
<i>Have a "happy ever after."</i>

554
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:37,964
Oh.

555
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,009
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

556
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,302
All right! That's more like it!

557
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,721
Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

558
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,140
♪ <i>Ain't no stoppin' us now</i> ♪

559
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,601
- ♪ <i>Whoo! We're on the move!</i> ♪
- Stop, Ogre!

560
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,896
- I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

561
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,983
On my honor, I am obliged
to accompany you until I have saved your life

562
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,318
as you have spared me mine.

563
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:02,238
I'm sorry, the position of annoying
talking animal has already been taken.

564
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,615
Let's go, Shrek.

565
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,074
Shrek?

566
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,462
- Shrek!
- Oh, come on, Donkey. Look at him

567
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,506
in his wee little boots.

568
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,841
You know, how many cats can wear boots?

569
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:22,926
Honestly?

570
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,886
- Aw, let's keep him.
- Say what?

571
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,433
Aw, listen, he's purring.

572
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:33,603
- Oh, so now it's cute?
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

573
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,232
Lighten up? Oh, I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

574
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:41,903
Shrek.

575
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,159
Shrek?

576
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,381
Well, they're both festive, aren't they?

577
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,132
What do you think, Harold?

578
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,927
Um, yes, yes. Fine. Fine.

579
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,599
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

580
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,977
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it really matters.

581
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,271
How do we know
there's even going to be a ball?

582
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,189
Mom! Dad!

583
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:21,985
- Oh, hello, dear.
- Um, what's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

584
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,737
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

585
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,615
I haven't. You should ask your father.

586
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:32,161
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

587
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,123
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um--

588
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,626
Hmm. Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

589
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,796
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

590
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,382
Ah, yes. Very good, then.

591
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,634
- Carry on, Cedric.
- Dad?

592
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,012
- Dad? Have you seen Shrek?
- Uh, no, I haven't, dear.

593
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:53,725
I-- I'm sure he just went off to look
for a nice mud hole to cool down in.

594
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,894
You know,
after your little spat last night.

595
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,146
Oh. You heard that, huh?

596
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,689
Darling, the whole kingdom heard you.

597
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:04,777
I mean, after all it is in his nature to be,
well, a bit of a brute.

598
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,656
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

599
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,118
Well, what did you expect?
I mean, look at what he's done to you.

600
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,204
Shrek loves me for who I am.

601
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,625
I would think you'd be happy for me.

602
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,253
Darling, I'm just thinking
about what's best for you.

603
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,923
Maybe you should do the same.

604
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,189
- No, really?
- Mm-hmm.

605
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,609
Shh, shh, shh...

606
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,071
Whoa.

607
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,995
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's just back away slowly.

608
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,830
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

609
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:01,417
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

610
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,212
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell?

611
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,923
Spell.

612
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,053
He makes me laugh.

613
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,307
Oh.

614
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,811
Hi. I'm here to see the--

615
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,022
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.

616
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:26,025
<i>Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!</i>

617
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,530
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

618
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,366
Look, she's not seeing
any client today, okay?

619
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,618
That's okay, buddy. We're from the union.

620
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:36,703
The union?

621
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:41,165
We represent the workers in all magical industries,
both evil and benign.

622
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,001
Oh! Oh, right.

623
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,129
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

624
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,131
Uh, a little.

625
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,882
We-- We don't even have dental.

626
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,467
They don't even have dental.

627
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,220
Okay.
We're just gonna have a look around.

628
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,430
Oh, by the way,

629
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,808
I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

630
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,145
- Know what I'm saying? Huh? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

631
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,148
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

632
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,846
A drop of desire.

633
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,098
Naughty.

634
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,435
A pinch of passion.

635
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,611
And just a hint of lust.

636
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,991
Excuse me.

637
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,785
Sorry to barge in like this but--

638
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,496
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

639
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,081
Well...

640
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:07,043
...it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy.

641
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,047
And there's some question
as to why that is?

642
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,092
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

643
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,764
Ah. P. P. P. P. Princess. Cinderella.

644
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,933
Here we are. "Lived happily ever after."

645
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,309
Oh!

646
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,811
No ogres.

647
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,938
Let's see. Snow White.

648
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,650
A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres.

649
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,985
Sleeping Beauty. Ooh, no ogres.

650
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,197
Hansel and Gretel? No.
Thumbelina? No.

651
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,242
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman.

652
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,245
No, no, no, no, no!

653
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:46,457
You see,
ogres don't live happily ever after.

654
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,667
All right, look, lady!

655
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,879
Don't you point those
dirty green sausages at me!

656
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,717
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.
Oh, sorry.

657
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,513
Ah! That's okay.
We were just leaving.

658
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,975
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

659
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,852
Just go.

660
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,186
Come on, guys.

661
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,871
TGIF, eh, buddy?

662
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,792
Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?

663
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,177
Oh!

664
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,013
Hey, man. You wanna get your fine
Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks

665
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,890
out of my face? Man, that stinks!

666
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:47,768
Well, you don't exactly smell
like a basket of roses.

667
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:55,359
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan.

668
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,029
Already our minds are becoming one.

669
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,822
Whoa, whoa, whoa, there.

670
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:03,034
Listen, if we need an expert on licking ourselves,
we'll give you a call.

671
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,203
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

672
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,748
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

673
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,417
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

674
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,002
<i>No problema,</i> boss.

675
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:17,381
In one of my nine lives I was the great
cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela.

676
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,134
Shrek, are you off your nut?

677
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,802
Donkey, keep watch.

678
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,721
Keep watch?
Yeah. I'm gonna keep watch.

679
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,599
I'll watch that wicked witch come down here
and whammy zammy a world of hurt

680
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,725
all up your backside.

681
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,686
I'm gonna laugh too.
If she do, I'm gonna be giggling to myself.

682
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,564
- What do you see?
- Toadstool softener?

683
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,317
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution

684
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,693
for marital problems.

685
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,695
- "Elfa Seltzer"?
- Uh-uh.

686
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:40,613
"Hex Lax"?

687
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,199
No! Try "handsome".

688
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,952
Sorry. No handsome.

689
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,997
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?

690
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,166
Well, what does it do?

691
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,628
It says "Beauty Divine."

692
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,048

696

697

What? Where is he, Mom?

722
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,549
I shall rend his head from his shoulders.

723
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,927
I will smite him where he stands.

724
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,014

Oh, put it away, junior!
You're still gonna be king.

726
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,355
We're just gonna have to come up

00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,065
<i>Pardon?</i> Um--

728
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:25,528

730
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,989
Oh.

731
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,535

this work to our advantage.

736
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,302
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona too.

737
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:55,015
Hey, man. This don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

738
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,060
So why don't you just drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here?

739
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:01,355
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?

740
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,777
Aha, see, you're allergic to that stuff.
You're gonna have a reaction.

741
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,947
And if you think that I'm gonna be
smearing Vapor Rub all over your chest,

742
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,115
think again!

743
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,368
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion,

744
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,370
allow me to take the first sip.

745
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,290
It would be an honor to lay
my life on the line for you.

746
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

747
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,712
I don't think so. If there's gonna be
any animal testing, I'm gonna do it.

748
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,798
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

749
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:34,889
How do you feel?

750
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:39,185
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?

751
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,853
You still look like an ass to me.

752
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,148
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

753
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,903
Well, here's to us, Fiona.

754
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,239
Shrek, you drink that,
there's no going back.

755
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,199
I know.

756
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,451
- But no more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.

757
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,077
- And no more itchy butt crack?
- I know!

758
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,163
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!

759
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,543
But I love Fiona more.

760
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,255
Shrek, no! Wait!

761
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,603
Whoo, cold. Got to be.

762
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,648
Shrek I think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.

763
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,732
Maybe it's a dud.

764
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,277
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

765
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,743
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I think I feel something coming on.

766
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,412
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

767
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:41,705
I don't want to die!

768
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,542
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!

I'm melting!

Oh.

772
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:37,011
Oh, Shrek, don't worry.
Things just seem bad because it's dark and rainy,

773
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,471
and Fiona's father hired
a sleazy hit man to whack you.

774
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,933

00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:36,375
Well,

841
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:40,212
look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

842
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,341
Uh, first things first.
We need to get you out of those clothes.

843
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,639
- Ready?
- Ready.

844
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,812
Driver, stop!

845
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,023
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

846
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:03,610
I'm blind! Tell the truth.
Will I ever be able to play the violin again?

847
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:07,698
Oh, you poor creature.
Is there anything I can do for you?

848
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,242
Well, I guess there is one thing.

849
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,036
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

850
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,376
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

851
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:30,470
Father?
Is everything all right, Father?

852
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,897
Thank you, gentlemen.
Someday, I will repay you.

853
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,983
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.

Shrek!

870
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,025
Fiona.

871
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,322
Hello, handsome.

872
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:14,992
Shrek!

873
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,536
Princess!

874
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,372
- Donkey?
- Wow! That potion worked on you, too, huh?

875
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,333
- W-What potion?
- It's kind of a long story,

876
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:28,005
but Shrek and I took some magic potion,
and, well, now, we're sexy!

877
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,758
Shrek?

878
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,305
For you, baby, I could be.

879
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,766
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

880
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,518
He just went inside looking for you.

881
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,188
Shrek!

882
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,149
Fiona!

883
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,775
Fiona!

884
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,279
You wanna dance, pretty boy?

885
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:59,077
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

886
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,705
Fiona.

887
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,125
Shrek?

888
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,045
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

889
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,796
What happened to your voice?

890
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,300
Uh, the potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona,

891
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,303
but not the way I feel about you.

892
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:17,804
Fiona?

893
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,642
- Charming?
- Uh, do you think so?

894
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,896
Dad, I was so hoping you'd approve.

895
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,773
Um, who are you?

896
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,733
Mom, it's me, Shrek.

897
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,403
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression

898
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,655
but, well, what do you think?

899
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,537
Fiona! Fiona!

900
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,247
Fiona!

901
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,999
Fiona!

902
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,919
- Fiona!
- "Fiona! Fiona!"

903
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,296
Oh, shoot!

904
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,715
I don't think they can hear us, pigeon.

905
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,930
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

906
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,682
I just wanted her to be happy.

907
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,518
And now she can be.

908
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,479
Oh, sweetheart.

909
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,024
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

910
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,317
But look at me.

911
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,153
Look what I've done for her.

912
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:18,615
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

913
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:22,744
She's a princess, and you're an ogre.

914
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,790
That's something no amount of potion
is ever going to change.

915
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,590
But...

916
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,759
I love her.

917
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,594
If you really love her,

918
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,639
you'll let her go.

919
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,021
- Shrek?
- <i>Señor.</i>

920
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,858
Hey, what's going on?
Where you going?

921
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,243
You wouldn't have had anything
to do with this, would you, Harold?

Just leave the bottle, Doris.

926
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,181
Hey, why the long face?

927
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,809
It was all just a stupid mistake.

928
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:32,564
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

929
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,735
I hate Mondays.

930
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,572
I can't believe you're gonna walk away
from the best thing that happened to you.

931
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,282
What choice do I have?

932
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,785
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

933
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,079
Oh, come on now.
Is he really that good-looking?

934
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,457
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous.

935
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,627
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

936
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,795
Mmm. He sounds dreamy.

937
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:59,716
You know, shockingly,
this isn't making me feel any better.

938
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:05,764
Look, guys, it's for the best.

939
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,435
Mom and Dad approve,
and Fiona gets the man she's always dreamed of.

940
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,771
Everybody wins.

941
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,649
Except for you.

942
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,027
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

943
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,528
Aye.

944
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,740
And that's why I have to let her go.

945
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,825
Um-- Excuse me...

946
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,036
is-- is she here?

947
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,121
She's, uh, in the back.

948
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,375
Oh, hello again.

949
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,589
Uh, Fairy Godmother. Charming.

950
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,718
You better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

951
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:49,391
Well, uh-- I'm afraid Fiona isn't really
warming up to Prince Charming.

952
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,851
Um, FYI, not my fault.

953
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,603
No, no, of course it's not, dear.

954
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:57,899
I mean, how charming can I be when I
have to pretend I'm that dreadful ogre?

955
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,651
No! No, it's nobody's fault.

956
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,405
Um, perhaps it's best
if we just call the whole thing off. Okay?

957
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,406
What?

958
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,367
You can't force someone to fall in love.

959
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,202
I beg to differ.

960
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,121
I do it all the time.

961
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,291
Have Fiona drink this,
and she'll fall in love

962
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:17,627
with the first man she kisses,
which will be Charming.

963
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,798
- Uh-- No.
- What did you say?

964
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,426
I-- I can't. I-- I won't do it.

965
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,011
Oh, yes, you will.

966
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,597
If you remember,
I helped you with your happily ever after,

967
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:33,226
and I can take it away just as easily.

968
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,395
Is that what you want?

969
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,479
Is it?

970
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:40,025
- N-- No.
- Good boy.

971
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:43,987
Now, we have to go.
I need to do Charming's hair before the ball.

972
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,656
He's hopeless.
You know, he's all high in the front.

973
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,576
He can never get to the back.
You always need someone to do the back.

974
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,203
- Oh, thank you, Mother.
- Mother?

975
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,249
Uh, Mary! A talking horse!

976
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,375
The ogre!

977
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,420
Stop them!

978
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,172
Thieves! Bandits!

979
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,798
Stop them!

980
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:08,011
Well, the abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the Maximus

981
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,639
here at tonight's
Far, Far Away Royal Ball Blowout!

982
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,517
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

983
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,478
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

984
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:20,732
Everyone who's anyone has turned out
to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

985
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:24,152
And, oh, my, the outfits look gorgeous!

986
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,445
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

987
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,281
What the heck are the crumbs for?

988
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,326
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

989
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,827
Oh, aren't they adorable?

990
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,079
Whoa!

991
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,374
Here comes Sleeping Beauty! Oh!

992
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,209
Tired old thing.

993
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,837
Who's this? Who's this? Who is this?

994
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:46,257
Oh! It's the one, it's the only,

995
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,927
it's the Fairy Godmother!

996
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:53,390
Hello, Far, Far Away!

997
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,225
Can I get a, "Whoop, whoop"?

998
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,768
Whoop, whoop!

999
01:04:56,851 --> 01:05:00,313
May all your endings be happy and--

1000
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,357
Well, you know the rest!

1001
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:06,611
<i>We'll be right back

1003
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,156
I hate these ball shows.

1004
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,326
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to <i>Wheel of Torture</i>.

1005
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,996
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.

1006
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,833
Ah, whizzes on you guys.

into the forest. Requesting backup.</i>

1011

01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,935
<i>their "devil may mare" attitudes
just won't fly.</i>

1013
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,271
<i>All right, all right! Let me go!</i>

1014
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,065
<i>Why you grabbing me? Ow!
Police brutality! Police brutality!</i>

1015
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,400
<i>Come on!</i>

1016
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:48,278
<i>- I have to talk to Princess Fiona!
- We warned you.</i>

1017
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,487
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

1018
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,407
<i>Will they get away with it
or did someone let the cat out of the bag?</i>

1019
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,326
<i>You, capitalist pig dogs!</i>

1020
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,329
<i>Get it off!</i>

1021
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:01,207
<i>- Catnip.
- That's, uh, not mine.</i>

1022
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:02,667
<i>Hold on, all right?</i>

1023
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,170
<i>- Find Princess Fiona!
- Come on, guy.</i>

1024
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,254
<i>I'm a donkey!</i>

1025
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,506
<i>Tell her Shrek-- I'm her husband, Shrek!</i>

1026
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,049
- <i>Ow, ow!</i>
- Knights.

1027
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,551
Quick! Rewind it!

1028
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,180
<i>Shrek-- I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow, ow!</i>

1029
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:43,958
Darling?

1030
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,253
Ah, I thought I might find you here.

1031
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:50,381
How about a nice,
hot cup of tea before the ball?

1032
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,009
I'm not going.

1033
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:56,638
B-B-But the-- the whole Kingdom's
turned out to celebrate your marriage.

1034
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,556
There's just one problem.

1035
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,308
That's not my husband.

1036
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,019
I mean, look at him.

1037
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:10,235
Yes, he is a bit different, but, uh,
people change for the ones they love.

1038
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,446
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.

1039
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,656
Change?

1040
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,575
He's completely lost his mind.

1041
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,787
Darling, why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

1042
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,165
I mean, you might find
you like this new Shrek.

1043
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:26,918
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.

1044
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,588
I'd give anything to have him back.

1045
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:37,011
Uh, darling, that's mine. Decaf.

1046
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,888
Otherwise I'm up all night.

1047
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,771
Mmm. Thanks.

1048
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:54,362
I got to get out of here!
You can't lock us up like this! Let me go!

1049
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,738
What about my Miranda rights?

1050
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,616
You're supposed to say
I have the right to remain silent.

1051
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,326
Nobody said I have
the right to remain silent!

1052
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,830
Donkey, you have
the right to remain silent.

1053
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,207
What you lack is the capacity.

1054
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,711
I must hold on before I, too,
go totally mad.

1055
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,130
Shrek? Donkey?

1056
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,674
Too late.

1057
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,760
Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here.

1058
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,304
Oh!

1059
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,393
Fire in the hole!

1060
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:45,705
Look out below!

1061
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,001
Quick, tell a lie.

1062
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,837
- Well, uh, what should I say?
- Anything, but quick!

1063
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,048
Say something crazy like,
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear."

1064
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,134
I'm-- I am wearing ladies' underwear.

1065
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,014
Are you?

1066
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,058
I most certainly am not!

1067
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,810
It looks like you most certainly am are.

1068
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,479
- I am not!
- What kind?

1069
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,064
- It's a thong!
- Ow!

1070
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,398
They're briefs.

1071
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:13,858
- Are not.
- Are too.

1072
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,401
- Are not!
- Are too!

1073
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,612
Here we go. Hang tight.

1074
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,868
Hey, wait, wait, wait! Ow, ow!
Hey, hey, hey!

1075
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,119
Ow!

1076
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,041
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

1077
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:32,251
- Mm-hmm?
- Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?

1078
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,378
Sorry, boss.

1079
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:36,172
Quit messing around.
We've got to stop that kiss!

1080
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,091
I thought you was going to let her go.

1081
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,468
I was,
but I can't let them do this to Fiona.

1082
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,763
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's finally coming around.

1083
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,598
But that's impossible.
We'll never get in.

1084
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,142
The castle is guarded
and there is a moat and everything!

1085
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:54,607
Well, folks, it looks like we're up
chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.

1086
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,530
What?

1087
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,198
Do you still know the Muffin Man?

1088
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,285
Well, sure. He's down on Drury Lane.
Why?

1089
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,371
Because we're gonna need flour.

1090
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,332
Lots and lots of flour.

1091
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,713
Gingy!

1092
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:21,175
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man.
We've got a big order to fill.

1093
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,598
It's alive!

1094
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,186
Whoa.

1095
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:39,235
Run, run, run as fast you can!

1096
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,494
Go, baby, go!

1097
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,999
There it is, Mongo. To the castle.

1098
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,753
No, no, no, you great stupid pastry!

1099
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:57,795
Come on!

1100
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,889
- Mongo, down here. Look at the pony.
- Ooh.

1101
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,474
Oh!

1102
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:11,976
That's right, follow the pretty pony.

1103
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,771
Pretty pony wants to play at the castle.

1104
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,022
Pretty pony.

1105
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:22,028
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting Princess Fiona

1106
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,323
and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

1107
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,285
Shrek, what are you doing?

1108
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,871
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

1109
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,582
Is that glitter on your lips?

1110
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:37,585
Mmm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste?

1111
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,879
Ugh! What is with you?

1112
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,380
But, Muffin Cake...

1113
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,469
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

Ladies and gentlemen.

1115
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,727
I'd like to dedicate this song to

1117
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,025

1185
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,078
No!

1186
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:22,638
Hi-yah!

1187
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:28,269
- Fiona.
- Shrek.

1188
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:32,106
Harold, you were supposed
to give her the potion!

1189
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:36,193
Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea.

1190
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:38,195
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

1191
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:46,370
I told you,
ogres don't live happily ever after.

1192
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:48,956
Harold!

1193
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,625
- Shrek!
- No!

1194
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:57,464
Ooh!

1195
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:58,966
Ha!

1196
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,601
Oh...

1197
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,520
Dad.

1198
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,314
Daddy...

1199
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,568
- Is he...
- Yup.

1200
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:20,696
He croaked.

1201
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,158
Harold?

1202
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:26,327
Dad?

1203
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:30,331
- I'd hoped you'd never see me like this.
- Man, and he gave you a hard time!

1204
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:33,876
- Donkey!
- No, no, he's right. I'm sorry...

1205
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,544
...to both of you.

1206
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,297
I only wanted what was best for Fiona.

1207
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,841
But I can see now

1208
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,135
she already has it.

1209
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:45,804
Shrek, Fiona,

1210
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:50,601
will you accept an old frog's apologies

1211
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,853
and my blessing?

1212
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,774
- Harold...
- I'm sorry, Lillian.

1213
01:18:56,857 --> 01:19:00,194
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.

1214
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:05,449
You're more that man today
than you ever were,

1215
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:06,659
warts and all.

1216
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,998
Boss, the Happily Ever After Potion!

1217
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,166
Midnight!

1218
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,045
Fiona, is this what you want?

1219
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,216
- To be this way forever?
- What?

1220
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,801
'Cause if you kiss me now,

1221
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,470
we can stay like this.

1222
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,973
You'd do that?

1223
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,850
- For me?
- Yes.

1224
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,903
I want what any princess wants,

1225
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,948
to live happily ever after...

1226
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,955
...with the ogre I married.

1227
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:59,086
Whatever happens, I must not cry.

1228
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,005
You cannot make me cry.

1229
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,739
No. No.

1230
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,115
No, no. No!

1231
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:29,450
Ow!

1232
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,493
No. No!

1233
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,455
Oh, no.

1234
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,675
Ugh.

1235
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:55,267
Hey, you still look
like a noble steed to me.

1236
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:02,524
Now, where were we?

1237
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,610
Ooh! I remember.

1238
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:12,785

1239
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,704
