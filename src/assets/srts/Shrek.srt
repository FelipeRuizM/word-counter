1
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:17,911
"Once upon a time
there was a lovely princess.

2
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,999
"But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort,

3
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,669
"which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.

4
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,381
"She was locked away in a castle

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,801
"guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,140
"Many brave knights had attempted
to free her from this dreadful prison,

7
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,225
"but none prevailed.

8
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,228
"She waited in the dragon's keep

9
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,231
"in the highest room of the tallest tower,

10
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:50,861
"for her true love
and true love's first kiss."

11
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,947
Like that's ever gonna happen.

12
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,242
What a load of...

13
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,757
- Go!
- Go!

14
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,204
- I think it's in there.
- All right. Let's get it!

15
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,041
Hold on. Do you know
what that thing can do to you?

16
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,085
Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.

17
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,131
Yes, well, actually,
that would be a giant.

18
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,260
Now, ogres, they're much worse.

19
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,263
They'll make a suit
from your freshly peeled skin.

20
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,432
- No!
- They'll shave your liver.

21
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,769
Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

22
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,396
- Actually, it's quite good on toast.
- Back! Back, beast!

23
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,607
Back! I warn ya!

24
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,821
Right.

25
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,341
This is the part where you run away.

26
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,142
And stay out!

27
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,106
"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

28
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,615
All right. This one's full. Take it away!

29
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,662
- Move it along. Come on! Get up!
- Next!

30
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,665
Give me that! Your flying days are over.

31
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,376
That's 20 pieces of silver
for the witch. Next!

32
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,212
- Get up! Come on!
- Twenty pieces.

33
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,383
- Sit down there!
- Keep quiet!

34
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,178
This cage is too small.

35
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,347
Please don't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again.

36
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,057
I can change.
Please! Give me another chance!

37
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,893
- Shut up.
- Next!

38
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,855
- What have you got?
- This little, wooden puppet.

39
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,733
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

40
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,320
Five shillings for the possessed toy.

41
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,489
- Take it away.
- Father, please! Don't let them do this!

42
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,241
- Help me!
- Next. What have you got?

43
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,202
Well, I've got a talking donkey.

44
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,832
Right. Well, that's good for 10 shillings,
if you can prove it.

45
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,751
Go ahead, little fella.

46
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,838
Well?

47
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,632
He's just... He's just a little nervous.

48
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,678
He's really quite a chatterbox.
Talk, you boneheaded dolt!

49
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,347
- That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
- No, no, he talks!

50
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,183
He does.

51
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,560
I can talk. I love to talk.

52
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,563
I'm the talkingest
damn thing you ever saw.

53
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,191
- Get her out of my sight.
- No, no!

54
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,695
I swear! He can talk!

55
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,408
Hey! I can fly!

56
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,118
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

57
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,912
He can talk!

58
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,582
That's right, fool!
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

59
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,293
You might have seen a housefly,
maybe even a superfly,

60
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,463
but I bet you ain't
never seen a donkey fly.

61
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,763
Seize him!

62
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,559
After him! He's getting away!

63
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,612
Get him! This way! Turn!

64
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,119
You, there. Ogre!

65
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,497
Aye?

66
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,249
By the order of Lord Farquaad,

67
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,668
I am authorized to place you both
under arrest

68
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:45,340
and transport you to
a designated resettlement facility.

69
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,469
Oh, really? You and what army?

70
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,232
Can I say something to you?

71
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,652
Listen, you was really, really somethin'
back there. Incredible!

72
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:11,491
Are you talkin' to me?

73
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,951
Yes, I was talkin' to you.

74
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,537
Can I tell you that you was great
back there? I mean, those guards.

75
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,331
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

76
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,375
They was trippin' over themselves
like babes in the woods.

77
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,377
That really made me
feel good to see that.

78
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,505
- That's great. Really.
- Man, it's good to be free.

79
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:31,136
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends?

80
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:37,267
But I don't have any friends,
and I'm not goin' out there by myself.

81
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,894
Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I'll stick with you.

82
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,896
You're a mean, green, fightin' machine.

83
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,190
Together, we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.

84
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,239
Wow! That was really scary.

85
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,615
And if you don't mind me sayin',

86
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,035
if that don't work, your breath
certainly will get the job done,

87
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,870
'cause you definitely need
some Tic Tacs or something,

88
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,246
'cause your breath stinks!

89
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,541
Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose,

90
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,461
just like the time...

91
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,004
And then I ate some rotten berries.

92
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,256
I had strong gases eking out of my butt
that day.

93
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,051
Why are you following me?

94
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,721
I'll tell you why.

95
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,724
<i>'Cause I'm all alone</i>

96
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,561
<i>There's no one here beside me</i>

97
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,772
<i>My problems have all gone</i>

98
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,609
<i>There's no one to deride me</i>

99
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,779
<i>But you gotta have friends</i>

100
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,907
Stop singing!

101
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,034
It's no wonder
you don't have any friends.

102
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,746
Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

103
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,917
Listen, little donkey.
Take a look at me. What am I?

104
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,050
- Really tall?
- No! I'm an ogre.

105
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,345
You know,
"Grab your torch and pitchforks."

106
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,430
Doesn't that bother you?

107
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,641
Nope.

108
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,602
- Really?
- Really, really.

109
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,814
Man, I like you. What's your name?

110
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,567
Shrek.

111
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,904
Shrek? Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

112
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,949
You got that kind of I-don't-care
what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

113
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,828
I like that. I respect that, Shrek.
You all right.

114
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,999
Look at that.
Who'd want to live in a place like that?

115
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,294
That would be my home.

116
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,424
And it is lovely! Just beautiful.
You are quite a decorator.

117
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,135
It's amazing what you've done
with such a modest budget.

118
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:39,973
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

119
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,438
I guess you don't entertain much,
do you?

120
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,314
I like my privacy.

121
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,234
You know, I do, too. That's another
thing we have in common.

122
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,111
Like, I hate it when
you got somebody in your face.

123
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,779
You're trying to give them a hint,
and they won't leave.

124
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,532
Then there's that big, awkward silence,
you know.

125
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,163
- Can I stay with you?
- What?

126
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,790
Can I stay with you, please?

127
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,209
- Of course!
- Really?

128
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,795
- No.
- Please! I don't wanna go back there!

129
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,674
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

130
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,343
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

131
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,555
- Please! Please!
- Okay! Okay!

132
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,224
- But one night only.
- Thank you!

133
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,643
- What are you... No! No!
- This is gonna be fun!

134
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,645
We can stay up late,
swappin' manly stories,

135
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,523
and in the mornin', I'm makin' waffles.

136
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,860
Where do I sleep?

137
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,695
Outside!

138
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,282
Oh, well, I guess that's cool.

139
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,034
I mean, I don't know you
and you don't know me,

140
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,536
so I guess outside is best, you know.

141
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,748
Here I go.

142
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,169
Good night.

143
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,925
I mean, I do like the outdoors.
I'm a donkey. I was born outside.

144
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,677
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside, I guess, you know.

145
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,055
By myself, outside.

146
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,935
<i>I'm all alone
There's no one here beside me</i>

147
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,835
I thought I told you to stay outside.

148
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,921
I am outside.

149
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,889
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

150
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,475
It's not home, but it'll do just fine.

151
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,604
- What a lovely bed.
- Got ya.

152
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,314
I found some cheese.

153
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,025
Awful stuff.

154
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,820
- Is that you, Gorder?
- How did you know?

155
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,532
Enough! What are you doing
in my house?

156
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,867
Hey!

157
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,954
Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

158
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,207
Where are we supposed to put her?
The bed's taken.

159
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,171
What?

160
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:03,009
I live in a swamp. I put up signs.
I'm a terrifying ogre!

161
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,720
What do I have to do
to get a little privacy?

162
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,017
Oh, no. Oh, no.

163
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,686
No! No!

164
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,649
What?

165
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,734
- Quit it.
- Don't push.

166
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,033
What are you doing in my swamp?

167
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,535
Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

168
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,955
Oh, dear.

169
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,503
All right, get out of here.
All of you, move it!

170
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,505
Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!
Hapaya! Hey!

171
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,548
- Quickly. Come on!
- No, no!

172
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,009
No, no. Not there. Not there.

173
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,391
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.

174
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,559
Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

175
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,229
- What?
- We were forced to come here.

176
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,439
- By who?
- Lord Farquaad.

177
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:03,277
He huffed <i>und</i> he puffed
<i>und</i> he signed an eviction notice.

178
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,072
All right.

179
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:10,410
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

180
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,287
I do. I know where he is.

181
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:17,083
Does anyone else
know where to find him?

182
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,795
- Anyone at all?
- Me! Me!

183
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,797
- Anyone?
- Pick me!

184
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,299
I know! I know! Me, me!

185
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,511
Okay, fine.

186
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:33,474
Attention, all fairy tale things.

187
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,937
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially worn out.

188
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,733
In fact, I'm gonna see
this guy Farquaad right now,

189
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,944
and get you all off my land
and back where you came from!

190
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,457
You! You're comin' with me.

191
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,001
All right, that's what I like to hear, man.

192
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,755
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends,
off on a whirlwind, big-city adventure.

193
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,840
I love it!

194
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,592
<i>On the road again</i>

195
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,093
- Sing it with me, Shrek.
- Hey.

196
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,512
<i>I can't wait to get
On the road again</i>

197
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,806
What did I say about singing?

198
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,141
- Well, can I whistle?
- No.

199
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,019
- Can I hum it?
- All right, hum it.

200
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,843
That's enough. He's ready to talk.

201
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,234
"Run, run, run, as fast as you can.

202
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,862
"You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man!"

203
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,533
- You're a monster.
- I'm not the monster here. You are.

204
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:18,287
You, and the rest of that fairy tale
trash, poisoning my perfect world.

205
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,872
Now, tell me! Where are the others?

206
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,749
Eat me!

207
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,503
I've tried to be fair to you creatures.

208
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,090
Now my patience has reached its end!
Tell me or I'll...

209
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,301
No, no, not the buttons.
Not my gumdrop buttons.

210
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,053
All right, then. Who's hiding them?

211
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:39,475
Okay, I'll tell you.
Do you know the muffin man?

212
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,894
- The muffin man?
- The muffin man.

213
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,398
Yes, I know the muffin man,
who lives on Drury Lane?

214
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,901
Well, she's married to the muffin man.

215
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,112
- The muffin man?
- The muffin man!

216
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,198
She's married to the muffin man.

217
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,950
My lord! We found it.

218
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,245
Well, then what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

219
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,597
- Magic Mirror...
- Don't tell him anything!

220
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,974
No!

221
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,811
'Evening.

222
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,771
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,

223
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,233
is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

224
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,903
Well, technically, you're not a king.

225
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,779
Thelonious.

226
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:39,118
- You were saying?
- What I mean is, you're not a king yet.

227
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,788
But you can become one.
All you have to do is marry a princess.

228
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,832
Go on.

229
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,587
So, just sit back and relax, my lord,

230
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,966
because it's time for you to meet
today's eligible bachelorettes.

231
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,510
And here they are!

232
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,554
Bachelorette number one

233
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,683
is a mentally abused shut-in
from a kingdom far, far away.

234
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,019
She likes sushi and hot-tubbing anytime.

235
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,564
Her hobbies include cooking
and cleaning for her two evil sisters.

236
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,025
Please welcome Cinderella.

237
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,569
Bachelorette number two
is a cape-wearing girl

238
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,154
from the land of fancy.

239
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,949
Although she lives with
seven other men, she's not easy.

240
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,577
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips
and find out what a live wire she is.

241
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,790
Come on. Give it up for Snow White!

242
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,125
And last, but certainly not least,

243
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,211
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead

244
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,838
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot, boiling lava!

245
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,508
But don't let that cool you off.
She's a loaded pistol

246
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,219
who likes piña coladas
and getting caught in the rain.

247
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:42,473
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

248
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,892
So, will it be bachelorette number one,

249
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:48,479
bachelorette number two
or bachelorette number three?

250
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,731
- Two! Two!
- Three! Three!

251
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,149
- Two! Two!
- Three!

252
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,360
Three? One? Three?

253
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,487
Three! Pick number three, my lord!

254
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,324
Okay, okay, number three!

255
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:05,204
Lord Farquaad,
you've chosen Princess Fiona.

256
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:14,714
Princess Fiona. She's perfect.

257
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,174
All I have to do is
just find someone who can go...

258
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,885
But I probably should mention
the little thing that happens at night.

259
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,887
- I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset...

260
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:26,058
Silence! I will make
this Princess Fiona my queen,

261
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:30,312
and Duloc will finally
have the perfect king!

262
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,606
Captain, assemble your finest men.

263
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,485
We're going to have a tournament.

264
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,699
But that's it. That's it right there.
That's Duloc.

265
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,367
I told ya I'd find it.

266
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:47,580
So, that must be
Lord Farquaad's castle.

267
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,749
That's the place.

268
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:54,045
Do you think maybe
he's compensating for something?

269
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,467
Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

270
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,428
Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

271
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,932
Hey, you!

272
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,478
Wait a second.
Look, I'm not gonna eat ya.

273
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,189
I just... I just...

274
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,597
It's quiet.

275
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,310
Too quiet.

276
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:58,025
- Where is everybody?
- Hey, look at this!

277
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,834
<i>Welcome to Duloc
Such a perfect town</i>

278
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,629
<i>Here we have some rules
Let us lay them down</i>

279
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,299
<i>Don't make waves, stay in line
And we'll get along fine</i>

280
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:26,011
<i>Duloc is a perfect place</i>

281
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:30,641
<i>Please keep off of the grass
Shine your shoes, wipe your face</i>

282
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,311
<i>Duloc is, Duloc is</i>

283
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:39,233
<i>Duloc is a perfect place</i>

284
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,158
Wow.

285
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:52,079
- Let's do that again!
- No. No. No, no, no! No.

286
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,792
Brave knights.

287
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:01,088
You are the best and brightest
in all the land.

288
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,591
Today, one of you shall prove himself...

289
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,177
All right. You're going the right way
for a smacked bottom.

290
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,053
Sorry about that.

291
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:13,642
That champion shall have the honor...
No, no, the privilege

292
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,730
to go forth and rescue
the lovely Princess Fiona

293
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,150
from the fiery keep of the dragon.

294
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,446
If for any reason
the winner is unsuccessful,

295
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,699
the first runner-up will take his place

296
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,577
and so on and so forth.

297
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,333
Some of you may die,
but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

298
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,757
Let the tournament begin!

299
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,139
What is that?

300
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,645
- It's hideous!
- That's not very nice.

301
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,773
It's just a donkey.

302
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,817
Indeed. Knights, new plan!

303
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:08,614
The one who kills the ogre
will be named champion! Have at him!

304
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,660
- Get him!
- Hey! Now, come on! Hang on now.

305
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,995
Go ahead! Get him!

306
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,749
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

307
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,084
Kill the beast!

308
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,420
No? All right then.

309
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,799
Come on!

310
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,857
Damn!

311
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,665
Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

312
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,550
Yeah!

313
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,721
The chair! Give him the chair!

314
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,743
Oh, yeah!

315
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,913
Thank you!

316
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:43,959
Thank you very much!
I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal!

317
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,301
Shall I give the order, sir?

318
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,971
No, I have a better idea.

319
00:25:56,055 --> 00:26:01,226
People of Duloc,
I give you our champion!

320
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,189
- What?
- Congratulations, ogre.

321
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,610
You've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

322
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:14,073
Quest? I'm already on a quest,
a quest to get my swamp back.

323
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,368
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!

324
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,953
Where you dumped
those fairy tale creatures!

325
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,750
Indeed. All right, ogre,
I'll make you a deal.

326
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,629
Go on this quest for me,
and I'll give you your swamp back.

327
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,423
Exactly the way it was?

328
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,259
Down to the last
slime-covered toadstool.

329
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,596
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.

330
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,436
What kind of quest?

331
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,272
Okay, let me get this straight.
You're gonna go fight a dragon

332
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,067
and rescue a princess just so
Farquaad will give you back a swamp,

333
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,070
which you only don't have because
he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

334
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,738
- Is that about right?
- You know what?

335
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,616
Maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk.

336
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,078
I don't get it, Shrek. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

337
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,247
You know, throttle him,
lay siege to his fortress,

338
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,166
grind his bones to make your bread,
the whole ogre trip.

339
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,168
I know what.

340
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,754
Maybe I could have
decapitated an entire village

341
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,673
and put their heads on a pike,

342
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,385
gotten a knife, cut open their spleen
and drink their fluids.

343
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,595
Does that sound good to you?

344
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,306
No, not really, no.

345
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,185
For your information, there's a lot more
to ogres than people think.

346
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,021
- Example?
- Example?

347
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:32,443
Okay, ogres are like onions.

348
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,112
- They stink?
- Yes. No!

349
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,613
- They make you cry?
- No!

350
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,699
You leave them out in the sun,
they get all brown,

351
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,117
start sproutin' little, white hairs.

352
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,202
No! Layers!

353
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,621
Onions have layers.

354
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:48,000
Ogres have layers! Onions have layers.

355
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,502
You get it? We both have layers.

356
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,382
You both have layers.

357
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,470
You know, not everybody likes onions.

358
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,181
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

359
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:06,185
I don't care what everyone likes.

360
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,980
Ogres are not like cakes.

361
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,401
You know what else
everybody likes? Parfaits.

362
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,070
Have you ever met a person,
you say, "Let's get some parfait,"

363
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,656
they say, "No, I don't like no parfait"?
Parfaits are delicious.

364
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,994
No! You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

365
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,788
Ogres are like onions! End of story.

366
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,708
Bye-bye. See ya later.

367
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,382
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

368
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,469
You know, I think I preferred
your humming.

369
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,222
Do you have a tissue or something?
'Cause I'm making a mess.

370
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,225
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

371
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,975
Shrek! Did you do that?

372
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,602
Man, you gotta warn somebody
before you just crack one off.

373
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,980
- My mouth was open and everything.
- Believe me, Donkey,

374
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,649
if it was me, you'd be dead.

375
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,485
It's brimstone.

376
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:41,738
- We must be getting close.
- Yeah, right, brimstone.

377
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,448
Don't be talking about it's the brimstone.

378
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,909
I know what I smell.
It wasn't no brimstone.

379
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,953
It didn't come off no stone neither.

380
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,308
Sure, it's big enough,
but look at the location.

381
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,646
Shrek?

382
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,108
Remember when you said
that ogres have layers?

383
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,276
Aye.

384
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,821
Well, I have a bit
of a confession to make.

385
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,448
Donkeys don't have layers.

386
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,283
We wear our fear right out there
on our sleeves.

387
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,161
Wait a second.
Donkeys don't have sleeves.

388
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,454
You know what I mean.

389
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,206
You can't tell me
you're afraid of heights.

390
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,126
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable
about being on a rickety bridge

391
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,878
over a boiling lake of lava!

392
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,007
Come on, Donkey.
I'm right here beside ya, okay?

393
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,760
For emotional support,

394
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:49,389
we'll just tackle this thing together
one little baby step at a time.

395
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,391
- Really?
- Really, really.

396
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,477
Okay, that makes me feel
so much better.

397
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,686
Just keep moving.

398
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:59,358
- And don't look down.
- Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

399
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,819
Don't look down.
Keep on moving. Don't look down.

400
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,698
Shrek! I'm lookin' down!

401
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,701
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off right now. Please.

402
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:13,330
- But you're already halfway.
- But I know that half is safe!

403
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,208
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back.

404
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,710
- Shrek, no! Wait!
- Just, Donkey...

405
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,880
- Let's have a dance then, shall we?
- Don't do that!

406
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,842
I'm sorry. Do what?

407
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,012
- This?
- Yes, that!

408
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:32,557
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

409
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,893
No, Shrek!

410
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,105
- No! Stop it!
- You said do it! I'm doin' it.

411
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,442
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

412
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,115
That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

413
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,162
Cool.

414
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,582
So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

415
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:01,420
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

416
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,423
I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

417
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,815
You afraid?

418
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,192
No, but...

419
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,612
Good. Me, neither.

420
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,284
'Cause there's nothin'
wrong with bein' afraid.

421
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,620
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

422
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,748
Unfamiliar dangerous situation,
I might add.

423
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,459
With a dragon that breathes fire
and eats knights and breathes fire,

424
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,085
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward

425
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,004
if you're a little scared,
you know what I mean?

426
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,506
'Cause I sure as heck ain't no coward.
I know that.

427
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,511
Donkey, two things, okay?

428
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,639
Shut up.

429
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,975
Now, go over there
and see if you can find any stairs.

430
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,686
Stairs? I thought we was lookin'
for the princess.

431
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,649
The princess will be up the stairs
in the highest room in the tallest tower.

432
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,320
- What makes you think she'll be there?
- I read it in a book once.

433
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,324
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

434
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,452
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt, too.

435
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,496
That's right. Those stairs won't know
which way they're goin'.

436
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,960
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

437
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,838
Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me.
I'm the stair master.

438
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,716
I've mastered the stairs.
I wish I had a step right here.

439
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,259
I'd step all over it.

440
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,016
Well, at least we know
where the princess is, but where's the...

441
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,185
Dragon!

442
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,203
Donkey, look out!

443
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,259
Got ya!

444
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,296
No. Oh, no. No!

445
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,632
Oh, what large teeth you have.

446
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,344
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.

447
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,680
I know you probably hear this
all the time from your food,

448
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,056
but you must bleach or something,

449
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,726
'cause that is one dazzling smile
you got there.

450
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,478
Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?

451
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,397
And you know what else?
You know what else?

452
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,317
You're... You're a girl dragon!

453
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,905
Sure. I mean,
of course you're a girl dragon.

454
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,783
'Cause you're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

455
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,202
What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye?

456
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,625
Man, I'd really love to stay,
but, you know, I'm...

457
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,585
I'm an asthmatic,
and I don't know if it'd work out

458
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,795
if you're gonna blow smoke rings
and stuff.

459
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,672
Shrek!

460
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,386
No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

461
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,171
- Wake up!
- What?

462
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,881
Are you Princess Fiona?

463
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,676
I am.

464
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,303
Awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

465
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,389
That's nice. Now, let's go.

466
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,474
But wait, Sir Knight.

467
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,851
This be-eth our first meeting.

468
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,647
Should it not be a wonderful,
romantic moment?

469
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,068
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
- Hey, wait. What are you doing?

470
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,237
You should sweep me off my feet,

471
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,699
out yonder window and down a rope
onto your valiant steed.

472
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,576
You've had a lot of time to plan this,
haven't you?

473
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,875
But we have to savor this moment!

474
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,712
You could recite an epic poem for me.

475
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,256
A ballad? A sonnet!

476
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,592
- A limerick? Or something!
- I don't think so.

477
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,097
Can I at least know
the name of my champion?

478
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,099
Shrek.

479
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,894
Sir Shrek.

480
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:14,733
I pray that you take this favor
as a token of my gratitude.

481
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,861
Thanks!

482
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,700
You didn't slay the dragon?

483
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,244
It's on my to-do list. Now, come on!

484
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,413
But this isn't right!

485
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,791
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

486
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,418
That's what all the other knights did.

487
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,795
Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

488
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,797
That's not the point.

489
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,968
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

490
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,095
Well, I have to save my ass.

491
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,390
What kind of knight are you?

492
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,893
One of a kind.

493
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,353
Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.

494
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,981
I believe it's healthy
to get to know someone

495
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,610
over a long period of time.
Just call me old-fashioned.

496
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,906
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

497
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,451
I'm not emotionally ready
for a commitment of this

498
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,828
magnitude, really,
is the word I'm looking for.

499
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:12,415
Magnitude. Hey,
that is unwanted physical contact.

500
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,959
Hey, what are you doing?

501
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:18,296
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little
and take this one step at a time.

502
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,216
We really should get to know each other
first as friends,

503
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,509
or maybe even as pen pals.

504
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:26,805
'Cause I'm on the road a lot,
but I just love receiving cards...

505
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,307
Hey, you know,
I'd really love to stay, but...

506
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,976
Hey, hey, don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

507
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,395
You're gonna tear it off.
I don't give permission to...

508
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,647
What are you gonna do with that?

509
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,359
Hey, now. No way. No! No!

510
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,195
No, no! No. No, no, no! No!

511
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,015
- Hi, Princess!
- It talks!

512
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,853
Yeah, it's getting him to shut up
that's the trick.

513
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,348
Okay, you two, head for the exit!

514
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,228
I'll take care of the dragon.

515
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,777
Run!

516
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,285
You did it!

517
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,247
You rescued me!
You're amazing. You're...

518
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:01,084
You're wonderful. You're...

519
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,461
A little unorthodox, I'll admit.

520
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:08,466
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

521
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,760
I am eternally in your debt.

522
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:16,766
And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?

523
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,186
All right, I hope you heard that.
She called me a noble steed.

524
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,521
She think I'm a steed.

525
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,774
The battle is won.

526
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,360
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

527
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,029
- No.
- Why not?

528
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,323
I have helmet hair.

529
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,618
Please. I would'st look
upon the face of my rescuer.

530
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,288
No, no, you wouldn't'st.

531
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,832
But how will you kiss me?

532
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,711
What? That wasn't
in the job description.

533
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,130
Maybe it's a perk.

534
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:51,634
No, it's destiny.
You must know how it goes.

535
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,513
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon

536
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,516
is rescued by a brave knight,

537
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,894
and then they share true love's first kiss.

538
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,063
With Shrek? You think... Wait.

539
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,317
Wait. Wait a second.
You think that Shrek is your true love?

540
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,402
Well, yes.

541
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,908
You think Shrek is your true love!

542
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,910
What is so funny?

543
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:21,080
Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

544
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:24,667
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

545
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,211
Now... Now, remove your helmet.

546
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,505
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

547
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,591
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

548
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,842
- Take it off.
- No!

549
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,011
- Now!
- Okay!

550
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:39,599
Easy. As you command, Your Highness.

551
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,112
You... You're an ogre.

552
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,075
You were expecting Prince Charming.

553
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,660
Well, yes, actually.

554
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:07,251
Oh, no. This is all wrong.
You're not supposed to be an ogre.

555
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:12,548
Princess, I was sent to rescue you
by Lord Farquaad, okay?

556
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,550
He's the one who wants to marry you.

557
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,552
Well, then why didn't he come
rescue me?

558
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,973
Good question. You should ask him that
when we get there.

559
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,896
But I have to be rescued by my true love,
not by some ogre and his pet.

560
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,065
So much for noble steed.

561
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,776
Look, Princess, you're not making
my job any easier.

562
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,238
Well, I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

563
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:40,576
You can tell Lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

564
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,995
I'll be waiting for him right here.

565
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,126
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy,
all right? I'm a delivery boy.

566
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,461
You wouldn't dare.

567
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,922
- Put me down!
- Ya comin', Donkey?

568
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,590
Yeah, I'm right behind ya.

569
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,261
Put me down,
or you will suffer the consequences!

570
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,097
This is not dignified! Put me down!

571
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,353
Okay, so here's another question.
Say there's a woman that digs you, right,

572
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,938
but you don't really like her that way.

573
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,399
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

574
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,985
but you don't get burned to a crisp
and eaten? How do you do that?

575
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,821
You just tell her she's not your true love.

576
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,615
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your...

577
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,409
Hey!

578
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,662
The sooner we get to Duloc the better.

579
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,665
Yeah, you're gonna love it there,
Princess. It's beautiful!

580
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,502
And what of my groom-to-be?
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

581
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,713
Let me put it this way, Princess.

582
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,634
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

583
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:43,973
I don't know, Shrek.
There are those who think little of him.

584
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,978
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

585
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,272
You know, you're just jealous you can
never measure up

586
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,025
to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

587
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,028
Yeah, well,
maybe you're right, Princess.

588
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,406
But I'll let you do the "measuring"
when you see him tomorrow.

589
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,702
Tomorrow? It'll take that long?

590
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:09,499
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No, that'll take longer.

591
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:14,045
- We can keep going.
- But there's robbers in the woods.

592
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,423
Time-out, Shrek! Camping's definitely
starting to sound good.

593
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:21,594
Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything
we're going to see in this forest.

594
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,055
I need to find somewhere to camp now!

595
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:35,024
- Hey! Over here.
- Shrek, we can do better than that.

596
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,693
Now, I don't think
this is fit for a princess.

597
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,905
No, no, it's perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.

598
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:45,618
Homey touches? Like what?

599
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:49,747
A door?
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

600
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,375
You want me to come in there and read
you a bedtime story? Because I will.

601
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,335
I said good night!

602
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,215
Shrek, what are you doing?

603
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:03,761
I... You know... Come on.
I was just kidding.

604
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:13,938
And that one, that's Throwback,

605
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,441
the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

606
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,653
Right. Yeah.

607
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,614
Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?

608
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,493
Well, the stars don't tell the future,
Donkey. They tell stories.

609
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:33,082
Look, there's Bloodnut, the flatulent.
You can guess what he's famous for.

610
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,792
All right, now I know
you're making this up.

611
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,461
No, look. There he is,

612
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,631
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

613
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,301
Man, that ain't nothin'
but a bunch of little dots.

614
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:47,680
You know, Donkey, sometimes things
are more than they appear.

615
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,017
Forget it.

616
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,274
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

617
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,775
Our swamp?

618
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,570
You know, when we're through
rescuing the princess and all that stuff.

619
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,699
We? Donkey, there's no we.
There's no our.

620
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,493
There's just me and my swamp.

621
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:13,831
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a 10-foot wall around my land.

622
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,044
You cut me deep, Shrek.
You cut me real deep just now.

623
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,380
You know what I think?

624
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:25,051
I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

625
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:29,305
- No, do ya think?
- Are you hidin' something?

626
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,432
Never mind, Donkey.

627
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,810
This is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

628
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,773
No, this is one of those
drop-it-and-leave-it-alone things.

629
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,360
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to talk about it?

630
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,236
- Why are you blocking?
- I'm not blocking.

631
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,489
- Yes, you are.
- Donkey, I'm warning you.

632
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,532
Who you trying to keep out?
Just tell me that, Shrek. Who?

633
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,743
Everyone! Okay?

634
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,579
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

635
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:56,832
For the love of Pete!

636
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,752
What's your problem, Shrek? What you
got against the whole world, anyway?

637
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,129
Look, I'm not the one
with the problem, okay?

638
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,091
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

639
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:09,178
People take one look at me
and go, "Help! Run!

640
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,514
"A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"

641
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,976
They judge me
before they even know me.

642
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,188
That's why I'm better off alone.

643
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,365
You know what?

644
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,369
When we met, I didn't think you was
just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

645
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,082
Yeah, I know.

646
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,585
So, are there any donkeys up there?

647
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:47,425
Well, there's Gabby,
the small and annoying.

648
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:52,430
Okay, okay. I see it now. The big, shiny
one, right there. That one there?

649
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,724
- That's the moon.
- Okay.

650
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,874
Again. Show me again.

651
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,506
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
Show me the princess.

652
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,055
Perfect.

653
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,665
Yeah, you know I like it like that.

654
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,711
- Come on, baby. I said I like it.
- Donkey, wake up.

655
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,421
- What?
- Wake up.

656
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,925
- What?
- Morning.

657
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,553
How do you like your eggs?

658
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:59,348
- Good morning, Princess!
- What's all this about?

659
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:03,644
You know, we kind of got off
to a bad start yesterday.

660
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:09,108
I wanted to make it up to you.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

661
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,403
Thanks.

662
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:17,324
Well, eat up.
We've got a big day ahead of us.

663
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,708
- Shrek!
- What? It's a compliment.

664
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,544
Better out than in, I always say.

665
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,505
Well, it's no way to behave
in front of a princess.

666
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:35,301
- Thanks.
- She's as nasty as you are.

667
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:40,014
You know,
you're not exactly what I expected.

668
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:44,310
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

669
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,649
Hey!

670
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,484
Princess!

671
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,029
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

672
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,407
Be still, <i>mon chérie,</i>
for I am your savior!

673
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,828
And I am rescuing you from this green

674
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,414
- beast.
- Hey!

675
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,417
That's my princess! Go find your own!

676
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,464
Please, monster!
Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

677
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,634
Look, pal, I don't know
who you think you are!

678
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:21,472
Of course! How rude.
Please, let me introduce myself.

679
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,724
Merry Men!

680
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,775
<i>I steal from the rich
And give to the needy</i>

681
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,902
<i>-He takes a wee percentage
-But I'm not greedy</i>

682
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,987
<i>I rescue pretty damsels
Man, I'm good</i>

683
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,782
<i>-What a guy, Monsieur Hood
-Break it down</i>

684
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,913
<i>I like an honest fight
And a saucy little maid</i>

685
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,289
<i>What he's basically saying is
He likes to get...</i>

686
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,374
<i>Paid</i>

687
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,458
<i>So</i>

688
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,126
<i>When an ogre in the bush
Grabs a lady by the tush</i>

689
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,629
<i>-That's bad
-That's bad</i>

690
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,298
<i>When a beauty's with a beast
It makes me awfully mad</i>

691
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,883
<i>He's mad
He's really, really mad</i>

692
00:52:57,967 --> 00:52:59,969
<i>I'll take my blade
And ram it through your heart</i>

693
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:04,640
<i>Keep your eyes on me, boys
'Cause I'm about to start</i>

694
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:14,191
- Man, that was annoying!
- You little...

695
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,680
Shall we?

696
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,975
Hold the phone.

697
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,479
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now.

698
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,565
- Where did that come from?
- What?

699
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,860
That! Back there. That was amazing!

700
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,403
Where did you learn that?

701
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,740
Well, when one lives alone,

702
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,576
one has to learn these things
in case there's a...

703
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,287
- There's an arrow in your butt!
- What?

704
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,957
- Would you look at that?
- No. This is all my fault.

705
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,751
- I'm so sorry.
- Why? What's wrong?

706
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,378
- Shrek's hurt.
- Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt?

707
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:17,713
No, Shrek's gonna die.

708
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,214
Donkey, I'm okay.

709
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:21,592
You can't do this to me, Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.

710
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,677
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head and cough.

711
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,930
- Does anyone know the Heimlich?
- Donkey! Calm down.

712
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,391
If you want to help Shrek,
run into the woods

713
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,560
and find me a blue flower
with red thorns.

714
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,396
Blue flower, red thorns.
Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns.

715
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,439
Blue flower, red thorns.

716
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,692
Don't die, Shrek. And if you see
a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

717
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,860
- Donkey!
- Donkey!

718
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,820
Yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

719
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,323
- Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?

720
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,617
For getting rid of Donkey.

721
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,952
Now, you hold still,
and I'll yank this thing out.

722
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,913
Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

723
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:54,541
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
- No, it's tender.

724
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,085
Now, hold on.

725
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,419
What you're doing is the opposite
of help.

726
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:58,921
Don't move.

727
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,839
- Look, look, time-out.
- Would you...

728
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:05,511
Okay. What do you propose we do?

729
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:08,222
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower,
red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

730
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,641
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't color blind!

731
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,810
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

732
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,978
Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

733
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,941
Not good.

734
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:22,528
Okay. Okay, I can nearly see the head.
It's just about...

735
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,620
Nothing happened. We were just...

736
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,873
Look, if you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask, okay?

737
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:38,502
Come on!
That's the last thing on my mind.

738
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:42,256
The princess here was just...

739
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,639
Hey, what's that? That's...
Is that blood?

740
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,094
Hey!

741
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,273
There it is, Princess.

742
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:25,776
Your future awaits you.

743
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,153
- That's Duloc?
- Yeah, I know.

744
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:30,739
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

745
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,450
which I think means he has a really...

746
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,452
I...

747
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:39,248
- I guess we better move on.
- Sure. But, Shrek?

748
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:43,001
I'm worried about Donkey.

749
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,462
- What?
- I mean, look at him.

750
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,548
- He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

751
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,133
Well, that's what they always say,

752
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,719
and then next thing you know,
you're on your back.

753
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,223
- Dead.
- You know, she's right.

754
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,142
You look awful.
Do you want to sit down?

755
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,937
- You know, I'll make you some tea.
- I didn't want to say nothin',

756
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,940
but I got this twinge in my neck,
and when I turn my head like this, look.

757
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,900
- See?
- Who's hungry?

758
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,319
- I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.

759
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:14,032
Hey, where you goin'?
Man, I can't feel my toes!

760
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,575
I don't have any toes!

761
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,578
I think I need a hug.

762
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,172
This is good. This is really good.

763
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,385
- What is this?
- Weedrat.

764
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,554
Rotisserie style.

765
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,222
No kidding.

766
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,058
Well, this is delicious.

767
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,311
Well, they're also great in stews.

768
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:47,065
Now, I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean weedrat stew.

769
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:54,323
I guess I'll be dining
a little differently tomorrow night.

770
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,786
Maybe you can
come visit me in the swamp sometime.

771
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,913
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

772
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:05,876
Swamp-toad soup, fish-eye tartare,
you name it.

773
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,254
I'd like that.

774
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,769
- Princess?
- Yes, Shrek?

775
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:31,151
I was wondering. Are you...

776
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,616
Are you gonna eat that?

777
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:48,168
Man, isn't this romantic?
Just look at that sunset.

778
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:53,006
Sunset? No! I mean, it's late.
It's very late.

779
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,591
- What?
- Wait a minute.

780
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,593
I see what's goin' on here.

781
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,596
- You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
- Yes!

782
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,433
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.
You know what, I'd better go inside.

783
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:07,229
Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to
be afraid of the dark, too, until...

784
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,981
Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

785
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,986
- Good night.
- Good night.

786
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:22,285
Now I really see what's goin' on here.

787
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,079
What are you talkin' about?

788
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,665
I don't even wanna hear it.
Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

789
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,959
I know you two were
diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

790
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,754
You're crazy.
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

791
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,966
Come on, Shrek.
Wake up and smell the pheromones.

792
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,718
- Just go on in and tell her how you feel.
- I...

793
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:42,806
There's nothing to tell.
Besides, even if I did tell her that,

794
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:48,395
well, you know...
And I'm not sayin' I do, 'cause I don't...

795
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,939
She's a princess, and I'm...

796
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:55,694
- An ogre?
- Yeah. An ogre.

797
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:00,824
- Hey, where you goin'?
- To get more firewood.

798
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:23,346
Princess? Princess Fiona?

799
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,645
Princess, where are you?

800
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,111
Princess?

801
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,202
It's very spooky in here.
I ain't playing no games.

802
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:58,215
- No! No!
- No, help!

803
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,926
- Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

804
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:04,095
- What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, I'm the princess.

805
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,556
It's me, in this body.

806
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,184
Oh, my God! You ate the princess!

807
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,019
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!

808
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,854
- Listen, keep breathing!
- No!

809
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:16,149
I'll get you out of there!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

810
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,652
- Shrek!
- This is me.

811
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,326
Princess?

812
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:31,373
What happened to you?
You're different.

813
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,084
- I'm ugly, okay?
- Well, yeah.

814
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,212
Was it something that you ate? 'Cause
I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

815
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,839
- You are what you eat, I said. Now...
- No.

816
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,260
I've been this way
as long as I can remember.

817
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:46,012
What do you mean? Look,
I ain't never seen you like this before.

818
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:48,807
It only happens
when the sun goes down.

819
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:55,855
"By night one way, by day another.
This shall be the norm

820
01:02:56,314 --> 01:03:02,237
"until you find true love's first kiss
and then take love's true form."

821
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,576
That's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

822
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,704
It's a spell.

823
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:15,292
When I was a little girl,
a witch cast a spell on me.

824
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,669
Every night I become this,

825
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,464
this horrible, ugly beast.

826
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:28,930
I was placed in a tower to await the day
my true love would rescue me.

827
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:31,725
That's why I have to marry
Lord Farquaad tomorrow

828
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:37,063
before the sun sets
and he sees me like this.

829
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,652
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad.

830
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:46,906
You're not that ugly.
Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

831
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,993
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24-7.

832
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:53,622
But, Donkey, I'm a princess,

833
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,416
and this is not how a princess
is meant to look.

834
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:01,004
Princess, how 'bout if you
don't marry Farquaad?

835
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,964
I have to.

836
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,884
Only my true love's kiss
can break the spell.

837
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,512
But, you know, you're kind of an ogre,

838
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,849
and Shrek, well,
you got a lot in common.

839
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,643
Shrek?

840
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,647
Princess, I... How's it going, first of all?

841
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,984
Good? Good for me, too. I'm okay.

842
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:28,365
I saw this flower and thought of you
because it's pretty and...

843
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:31,826
Well, I don't really like it,
but I thought you might like it

844
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:36,706
'cause you're pretty.
But I like you anyway. I'd...

845
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,003
I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

846
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,297
I can't just marry whoever I want.

847
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,841
Take a good look at me, Donkey.

848
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:48,677
I mean, really,

849
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,721
who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

850
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,932
Princess and ugly don't go together.

851
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,434
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

852
01:04:56,518 --> 01:05:00,939
My only chance to live happily
ever after is to marry my true love.

853
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:06,277
Don't you see, Donkey?
That's just how it has to be.

854
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,199
It's the only way to break the spell.

855
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,118
You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

856
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:16,496
No! You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

857
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,124
What's the point of being able to talk
if you gotta keep secrets?

858
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,668
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

859
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,587
All right, all right. I won't tell him.
But you should.

860
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,965
I just know before this is over,
I'm gonna need

861
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,968
a whole lot of serious therapy.
Look at my eye twitchin'.

862
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,413
I tell him, I tell him not.

863
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,333
I tell him, I tell him not.

864
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,003
I tell him.

865
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:09,841
Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want...

866
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,822
Shrek.

867
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,328
- Are you all right?
- Perfect! Never been better.

868
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,664
I... I don't...
There's something I have to tell you.

869
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,334
You don't have to tell me
anything, Princess.

870
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,086
- I heard enough last night.
- You heard what I said?

871
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,963
Every word.

872
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,465
I thought you'd understand.

873
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,300
I understand.

874
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:56,429
Like you said, "Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?"

875
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,182
But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

876
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,309
Yeah? Well, it does.

877
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,064
Right on time.

878
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,858
Princess, I've brought you
a little something.

879
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,866
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

880
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,577
Who said that?
Couldn't have been a donkey.

881
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:23,081
Princess Fiona.

882
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,209
As promised. Now, hand it over.

883
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:30,797
Very well, ogre. The deed
to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

884
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,300
Take it and go
before I change my mind.

885
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,595
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you,

886
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,098
but you startled me,

887
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:43,852
for I have never seen
such a radiant beauty before.

888
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:47,021
I am Lord Farquaad.

889
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:50,942
Lord Farquaad? No, no.

890
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:54,779
Forgive me, my lord,
for I was just saying a short

891
01:07:58,116 --> 01:07:59,492
farewell.

892
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:04,581
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

893
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,791
It's not like it has feelings.

894
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:10,253
No, you're right. It doesn't.

895
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:14,340
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair,
flawless Fiona.

896
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,677
I ask your hand in marriage.

897
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,639
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

898
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:31,190
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

899
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,527
Excellent! I'll start the plans,
for tomorrow we wed!

900
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:38,865
No! I mean, why wait?

901
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,660
Let's get married today before sunset.

902
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,455
Anxious, are we? You're right.

903
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:49,459
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

904
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,878
There's the caterer,
the cake, the band, the guest list.

905
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,381
Captain, round up some guests!

906
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,967
Fare thee well, ogre.

907
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,303
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

908
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,888
Yeah? So what?

909
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,848
Shrek, there's something about her
you don't know.

910
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:05,725
Look, I talked to her last night. She's...

911
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:10,271
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

912
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,691
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

913
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:15,735
Shrek, I wanna go with you.

914
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,780
I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me.

915
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,951
I live alone!
My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

916
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,994
Understand? Nobody!

917
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:29,916
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

918
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,169
- But I thought...
- Yeah. You know what?

919
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,921
You thought wrong!

920
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,591
Shrek.

921
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:03,945
Donkey? What are you doing?

922
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:07,156
I would think, of all people, you would
recognize a wall when you see one.

923
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,908
Well, yeah.

924
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,411
But the wall's supposed
to go around my swamp, not through it.

925
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:15,289
It is around your half.
See, that's your half, and this is my half.

926
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:18,000
Your half.

927
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:20,711
Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.

928
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,922
I did half the work, I get half the booty.

929
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:26,551
Now, hand me that big, old rock,
the one that looks like your head.

930
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,928
- Back off!
- No, you back off.

931
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,305
- This is my swamp!
- Our swamp.

932
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:32,640
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go.

933
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,809
- Stubborn jackass!
- Smelly ogre.

934
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,103
Fine!

935
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,063
Hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you yet.

936
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:40,815
Well, I'm through with you.

937
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,943
You know, with you, it's always,
"Me, me, me!"

938
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:48,823
Well, guess what! Now it's my turn!
So, you just shut up and pay attention!

939
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,700
You are mean to me.

940
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:53,494
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

941
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:56,164
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.

942
01:12:56,247 --> 01:13:00,543
Yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?

943
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,838
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

944
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:07,133
Yeah. You're right, Donkey.

945
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:11,429
I forgive you
for stabbin' me in the back!

946
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:15,433
You're so wrapped up in layers,
onion boy,

947
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:16,934
you're afraid of your own feelings.

948
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,102
Go away!

949
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:20,771
See, there you are, doing it again
just like you did to Fiona.

950
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:23,149
All she ever do was like you,
maybe even love you.

951
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:27,653
Love me?
She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.

952
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,405
I heard the two of you talking.

953
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:33,409
She wasn't talkin' about you.
She was talkin' about somebody else.

954
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,498
She wasn't talking about me?

955
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,125
Well, then who was she talking about?

956
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:44,629
No way. I ain't saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me, right?

957
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:47,423
- Right? No!
- Donkey!

958
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:51,010
Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

959
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,435
I'm sorry.

960
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:03,773
I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

961
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,651
Can you forgive me?

962
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,239
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

963
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:15,826
- Right. Friends?
- Friends.

964
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:21,207
So, what did Fiona say about me?

965
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:25,044
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her?

966
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,588
The wedding!
We'll never make it in time.

967
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:32,343
Never fear, for where there's a will,
there's a way, and I have a way.

968
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,850
Donkey?

969
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:42,395
I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

970
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:46,315
- Come here, you.
- All right, all right.

971
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,442
Don't get all slobbery.
No one likes a kiss-ass.

972
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:51,070
All right, hop on and hold on tight.

973
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,239
I haven't had a chance
to install the seat belts yet.

974
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,190
People of Duloc,

975
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:33,738
we gather here today to bear witness

976
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:38,284
- to the union of our new king.
- Excuse me.

977
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,579
Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

978
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,080
Go on.

979
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:51,630
Go ahead, have some fun. If we
need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

980
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:56,427
Shrek, wait, wait! Hey! Wait a minute!

981
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,013
- You wanna do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

982
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,639
There's a line you gotta wait for.

983
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,267
The priest is gonna say,
"Speak now or forever hold your peace."

984
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:05,686
And that's when you say, "I object!"

985
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,355
I don't have time for this!

986
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,357
Wait. What are you doing?
Listen to me!

987
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,108
- Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.

988
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:12,610
- You wanna hold her?
- Yes.

989
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:13,861
- Please her?
- Yes!

990
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:17,615
<i>Then you got to, got to try
a little tenderness</i>

991
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,991
The chicks love that romantic crap!

992
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:22,286
All right! Cut it out.
When does this guy say the line?

993
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,538
We gotta check it out.

994
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:28,709
- And so, by the power vested in me...
- What do you see?

995
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:30,378
The whole town's in there.

996
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,589
- I now pronounce you husband...
- They're at the altar.

997
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,926
- ...and wife, king and queen.
- Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

998
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,844
For the love of Pete!

999
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,932
I object!

1000
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:46,769
- Shrek?
- Now what does he want?

1001
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:54,318
Hi, everyone.
Havin' a good time, are ya?

1002
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:56,570
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

1003
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,072
What are you doing here?

1004
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:01,283
Really, it's rude enough
being alive when no one wants you,

1005
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:04,703
- but showing up uninvited to a wedding.
- Fiona!

1006
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,790
- I need to talk to you.
- Now you wanna talk?

1007
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,709
Well, it's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me.

1008
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:13,295
- But you can't marry him.
- And why not?

1009
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:17,383
Because, because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

1010
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,885
Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

1011
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:23,305
- He's not your true love.
- And what do you know about true love?

1012
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:26,434
Well, I...

1013
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:29,353
- I mean...
- This is precious.

1014
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:34,108
The ogre has fallen in love
with the princess!

1015
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,568
Good Lord.

1016
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,446
An ogre and a princess!

1017
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,745
Shrek, is this true?

1018
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:50,624
Who cares? It's preposterous!

1019
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:54,253
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away
from our "happily ever after."

1020
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,380
Now, kiss me!

1021
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,346
"By night one way, by day another."

1022
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,559
I wanted to show you before.

1023
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:36,212
Well, that explains a lot.

1024
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:40,132
It's disgusting!

1025
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,009
Guards! Guards!

1026
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:45,471
I order you to get that
out of my sight now! Get them!

1027
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,014
- Get them both!
- No, no!

1028
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,933
This hocus-pocus alters nothing.

1029
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:52,061
This marriage is binding,
and that makes me king!

1030
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,438
- See? See?
- No, let go of me! Shrek!

1031
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:56,232
- No!
- Don't just stand there, you morons.

1032
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,400
Get out of my way! Fiona!

1033
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:07,284
I'll make you regret the day we met.
I'll see you drawn and quartered!

1034
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,120
- You'll beg for death to save you!
- No! Shrek!

1035
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:12,498
And as for you, my wife...

1036
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,582
Fiona!

1037
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,585
...I'll have you locked back in that tower
for the rest of your days!

1038
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:22,383
I am king! I will have order!
I will have perfection! I will have...

1039
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:31,517
All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon
here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

1040
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,728
I'm a donkey on the edge!

1041
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,151
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?

1042
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:45,823
Go ahead, Shrek.

1043
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,119
Fiona?

1044
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,996
Yes, Shrek?

1045
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:56,083
I love you.

1046
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,877
Really?

1047
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,463
Really, really.

1048
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,009
I love you, too.

1049
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:17,021
<i>"Until you find true love's first kiss</i>

1050
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:20,357
<i>"and then take love's true form."</i>

1051
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,134
<i>"Take love's true form.
Take love's true form."</i>

1052
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,267
Fiona?

1053
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:02,149
Fiona. Are you all right?

1054
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,320
Well, yes.

1055
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:10,741
But I don't understand.
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1056
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,412
But you are beautiful.

1057
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,376
I was hoping this would be
a happy ending.

1058
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:12,261
God bless us, every one.

1059
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,792
That's funny.

1060
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:27,419
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
